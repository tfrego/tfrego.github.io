            <h5>Delicate Arch | Arches National Park | Moab, Utah</h5>
            <p>Tony and I made several camping trips down to southern Utah.
              The Arches National Park is usually a stop for us when visiting Moab.
              The arches are beautiful in itself, and the quiet surrounding adds
              a remoteness you can't get in most places. There are so many trails to
              explore, you can spend many hours there. Also, the town of Moab is a great
              spot to grab a bite if you want to venture into town after a hard day of
              mountain biking. This is definitely a place we will return to.</p>

            <h5>Wasatch Mountains | Ogden, Utah</h5>
            <p>Living in Ogden gave us quick access to the hiking trails. After a day
              in the office, it was a normal evening routine for us to do a quick
              hike with our yellow lab, Jack. This is one of the things I miss most
              about living in Utah. Hiking trails, climbing routes, ski resorts were
              all within a 30 minute drive.</p>

            <h5>Mt Timpanogos | Utah</h5>
            <p>This was one of the most memorable hikes I've ever experienced. It was quite
            long but very much worth it. We trekked through the woods, crossed a field of
            beautiful spring wild flowers, came across a few mountain goats, and witnessed
            hikers skiing down the glaciers at the top of the peak.</p>
            <p>After a long and strenuous hike that started before the sun came up and ended
            well into the afternoon, we rewarded ourselves with a feast at In n Out. What a day.</p>

            <h5>Yellowstone National Park | Wyoming</h5>
            <p>After several years in Utah, Tony and I finally took a road trip to Wyoming
            to visit Yellowstone. What a sight it was to witness the geysers and the natural
            beauty of this national park.</p>
